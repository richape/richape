## Introduction
I have recently completed the Level 6 Certificate in Applied Web Development through Dev Academy Aotearoa. I have always been fascinated in Tech from Digital Art to wanting to be a game developer. At the time my reason for wanting to go on this journey was to engage better with students as a Human Skills Facilitator. I feel like I was able to do this at a higher level as I had learnt what students went through on a day to day basis and what tech languages and packages students would be exposed to while studying at Dev Academy. On top of this achievement I have found out more about my style of learning and have a keen interest in using these skills to develop my work from study and personal projects.

Now I am venturing in similar kind of work with Take2 in Newmarket, Auckland. Working with students who are apart of the New Zealand Corrections system. Using skills gained at Dev Academy in hopes to share those learnings to encourage and help students aspire to be developers in the Aotearoa Tech Sector.

Still want to find time to complete my personal projects but at this stage I just want to settle in with my mahi.

## Projects
- [My Blog](https://richape.github.io/index.html): This is my first project I worked on as part of the Foundations of learning Web Development using html & CSS,
- [To do list](https://github.com/richape/Todo-List): This is a Todo list app that I did a code along to before Foundations using React.
- [Matrix Effect](https://github.com/richape/matrix-effect): This was a project that I was playing around with in between study. Trying to build the Matrix effect using html, CSS and Javascript. Work in progress.
- [My Comics](https://github.com/richape/my-comics): Link will be added.

## Future Projects
I have a couple personal projects I have not started yet.

- One is a book a desk app for our work space where graduates who wish to come in to do some extra study or job hunting prep can book a desk. Users will be able to book a desk on a certain date or dates and also at what time.
- Another is a [Human Skills reflection app](https://github.com/richape/Human-Skills-App) for mobile and desktop, because Google forms is difficult to work with. Students will be able to create a log in and the app will include assessments and text area to complete reflections. I want to be able to implement some kind of notification for students as well, reflections will be saved and should be editable.
